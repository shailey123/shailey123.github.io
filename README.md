## Welcome to Shailey123

Hi I am Shailey. I have been studying Machine learning for the past 3 years. This is my blog wher I provide quick updates on machine learning concepts, review theoretical stuff and try and help you with whatver i have learnt by 'paying forward'

What are the types of topics that I will be providing write ups on? The list is below. These represent startingpoints. But, basically, whenever I am confused or don't understand something, I will write it up here. Hopefully the act of teaching it will help me clarify my ideas, and will help you clarify yours.

My topic list:
1. Decoding Deep Learning by goodfeelow, Bengio and Courville
This book is the bible for machine learning. However it is difficult to understand. There are many times I have been tempted to skip it as it is a difficult read. As I progressed I realized that the reason the book is so difficult to read is because it is trying to compact and summarize material across multiple discplines: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability theory, statistical pattern recognition, numericcal optimization, machine learning concpets, deep learning concepts. It's a lot! So, what the authors have done is summarize a lot. When you read it first time, it makes little sense. then, you need to google the main concepts and read about them. After you have spent sometime reading and understanding, then come back and read the Deep Learnig book again. Suddenly it all starts to make sense!
Well what I am going to try to do here is to decode what the book is trying to do. Hopefulyl, it will help you on your journey as well.
2. Review and explain concepts that keep popping up in machine learning such as Tensors, KL divergence, TF IDF, etc. These are basic concepts, yet we frequently get confused by them

3. I will be talking a little about applications as well. New ways in which we can deploy machine learning concepts.

Do let me kow your feedback. Hope you enjoy!

Shailey
