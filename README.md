## Welcome to Deep Learning Textbook Explained

Hi I am Shailey. I have been studying Machine learning for the past 3 years. This is my blog where I provide quick updates on machine learning concepts, review theoretical stuff and try and help you with whatver I have learnt by 'paying forward'

What are the types of topics that I will be providing write ups on? The list is below. These represent starting points. But, basically, whenever I am confused or don't understand something, I will write it up here. Hopefully the act of teaching it will help me clarify my ideas, and will help you clarify yours.

## My topic list:
1. Decoding Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville
This book is the bible for machine learning. However it is difficult to understand. There are many times I have been tempted to skip it as it is a difficult read. As I progressed I realized that the reason the book is so difficult to read is because it is trying to compact and summarize material across multiple discplines: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability theory, statistical pattern recognition, numericcal optimization, machine learning concepts, deep learning concepts. It's a lot! So, what the authors have done is summarize a lot. When you read it first time, it makes little sense. Then, you need to google the main concepts and read about them. After you have spent sometime reading and understanding, then come back and read the Deep Learning book again. Suddenly it all starts to make sense!
Well what I am going to try to do here is to decode what the book is trying to do. Hopefully, it will help you on your journey as well.
2. Review and explain concepts that keep popping up in machine learning such as Tensors, KL divergence, TF IDF, etc. These are basic concepts, yet we frequently get confused by them

## How I plan to go about it
Also before I start let me add a line or two on how I plan to proceed on explaining very difficult topics, both to myself and the world. I have been trying to read the Deep Learning textbook for quite sometime. For people not studying in an MS program at Stanford or some such university, it is probably the only pathway to enter into the higher echelons of deep learning. Apart from this book, the material covered is available as difficult to digest lecture notes of various professors, Arxiv papers and a large number of TowardsDataScience ( TDS) blog articles ( which may or may not be gated, depending on your access leves). In any case I am not the biggest fan of TDS blogs. They are useful for concepts that are well known or for practical code jupyter notebook type guides. The Deep Learning text book is like a good, but highly summarized map. If you follow its path, it definitely leads somewhere, but you also have to really do your own research in parallel to get the 'on the ground' path. 

One of the key barriers to doing difficult stuff is the emotional barrier. It's something that no one really talks about. Its kind of assumed that you are raring to read lots of complex equations, interspered with concepts that either you have never heard off or have only a very vague idea about. It is difficultperiod. Even more than the intellectual barrier, I think it is the emotional barrier that is tougher to cross. Procrastination sets in pretty early, and is difficult to overcome. I have tried many things and, this github blog is one of them. Hopefully, it is more successful. Here's what I plan to do: everythime I feel I am hitting an emotional barrier related to the material, I am going to discuss it right there in the blog. These passages are parenthitical, and hence I will put them in *italics*. Sometimes these *italisized* passages will discuss emotional barrers ( I am feeling sleepy, overwhelmed, don't understand anything, etc), at others I will discuss strategies on how to tackle the material ( need to research this concept, find a more userfriendly exposition, etc). The reason I include them is not break the flow, but with very difficult concepts, a straightforward unidirectional exposition, no matter how well done, may just not address your challenges. Think of this blog as a kind of Youtube video, where apart from teaching the concepts, the host also talks about problems and issues.


3. I will be talking a little about applications as well. New ways in which we can deploy machine learning concepts.

Do let me know your feedback. Hope you enjoy!

Shailey
