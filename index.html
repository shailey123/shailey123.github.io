	<h1>Welcome to Deep Learning Textbook Explained!</h1>
	<p>Hi Hi I am Shailey. I have been studying Machine learning for the past 3 years.<p>
	<p>This is my blog where I provide quick updates on machine learning concepts, review theoretical stuff and try and help you with whatever I have learnt by 'paying forward'.<p>
	<p>What are the types of topics that I will be providing write ups on? The list is below. These represent starting points. But, basically, whenever I am confused or don't understand something, I will write it up here. Hopefully, the act of teaching it will help me clarify my ideas and will help you clarify yours. <p>
	
	<h3>My Topic List<h3>
		<ol>
			<li>1.	Decoding Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville This book is the bible for machine learning. However, it is difficult to understand. There are many times I have been tempted to skip it as it is a difficult read. As I progressed I realized that the reason the book is so difficult to read is because it is trying to compact and summarize material across multiple disciplines: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability theory, statistical pattern recognition, numerical optimization, machine learning concepts, deep learning concepts. It's a lot! So, what the authors have done is summarize a lot. When you read it first time, it makes little sense. Then, you need to google the main concepts and read about them. After you have spent some time reading and understanding, then come back and read the Deep Learning book again. Suddenly it all starts to make sense! Well what I am going to try to do here is to decode what the book is trying to do. Hopefully, it will help you on your journey as well.</li>
