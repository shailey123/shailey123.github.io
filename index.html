	<h1>Welcome to Deep Learning Textbook Explained!</h1>
	<p>Hi I am Shailey. I have been studying Machine learning for the past 3 years. This is my blog where I provide quick updates on machine learning concepts, review theoretical stuff and try and help you with whatver I have learnt by 'paying forward'.
		What are the types of topics that I will be providing write ups on? The list is below. These represent starting points. But, basically, whenever I am confused or don't understand something, I will write it up here. Hopefully the act of teaching it will help me clarify my ideas, and will help you clarify yours.
