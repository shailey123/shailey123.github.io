	<h1>Welcome to Deep Learning Textbook Explained!</h1>
	<p>Hi I am Shailey. I have been studying Machine learning for the past 3 years.</p>
	<p>This is my blog where I provide quick updates on machine learning concepts, review theoretical stuff and try and help you with whatever I have learnt by 'paying forward'.</p>
	<p>The Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio & Courville is the bible for machine learning. However, it is difficult to understand. There are many times I have been tempted to skip it as it is a difficult read. As I progressed I realized that the reason the book is so difficult to read is because it is trying to compact and summarize material across multiple disciplines: Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability theory, statistical pattern recognition, numerical optimization, machine learning concepts, deep learning concepts. It's a lot! So, what the authors have done is summarize a lot. When you read it first time, it makes little sense. Then, you need to google the main concepts and read about them. After you have spent some time reading and understanding, then come back and read the Deep Learning book again. Suddenly it all starts to make sense! Well what I am going to try to do here is to decode what the book is trying to do. Hopefully, it will help you on your journey as well.</p>
	<p>What are the types of topics that I will be providing write ups on? The list is below. These represent starting points. But, basically, whenever I am confused or don't understand something, I will write it up here. Hopefully, the act of teaching it will help me clarify my ideas and will help you clarify yours.</p>
	
	<h2>My Topic List</h2>
		<ol>
			<ol>
			<li style="font-size:30px">Explaining concepts in Deep Learning by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville</li>
			<li style="font-size:30px">Review and explain concepts that keep popping up in machine learning such as Tensors, KL divergence, TF IDF, etc.</li></font>
                        <li style="font-size:30px">Applications and updates of concepts discussed in the book, since the book was written quite some time back</li></font>
                        </ol>
		</ol>
	
	<h2>How I plan to go about it</h2>
	<p>Also before I start let me add a line or two on how I plan to proceed on explaining very difficult topics, both to myself and the world. I have been trying to read the Deep Learning textbook for quite some time. For people not studying in an MS program at Stanford or some such university, it is probably the only pathway to enter the higher echelons of deep learning. Apart from this book, the material covered is available as difficult to digest lecture notes of various professors, ArXiv papers and a large number of Towards Data Science (TDS) blog articles ( which may or may not be gated, depending on your access levels). In any case I am not the biggest fan of TDS blogs. They are useful for concepts that are well known or for practical code Jupyter notebook type guides. The Deep Learning textbook is like a good, but highly summarized map. If you follow its path, it definitely leads somewhere, but you also have to really do your own research in parallel to get the 'on the ground' path.</p>
<p>One of the key barriers to doing difficult stuff is the emotional barrier. It's something that no one really talks about. Itâ€™s kind of assumed that you are raring to read lots of complex equations, interspersed with concepts that either you have never heard off or have only a very vague idea about. It is difficult period. Even more than the intellectual barrier, I think it is the emotional barrier that is tougher to cross. Procrastination sets in pretty early and is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>I have tried many things and, this github blog is one of them. Hopefully, it is more successful. Here's what I plan to do: every time I feel I am hitting an emotional barrier related to the material, I am going to discuss it right there in the blog. These passages are parenthetical, and hence I will put them in italics. Sometimes these italicized passages will discuss emotional barriers ( I am feeling sleepy, overwhelmed, don't understand anything, etc), at others I will discuss strategies on how to tackle the material ( need to research this concept, find a more user-friendly exposition, etc). The reason I include them is not break the flow, but with very difficult concepts, a straightforward unidirectional exposition, no matter how well done, may just not address your challenges. Think of this blog as a kind of YouTube video, where apart from teaching the concepts, the host also talks about problems and issues, but without the drawbacks of videos such as inability to skip ahead or back without losing track, having to listen rather than read, etc.</p>

<p>Do let me know your feedback. Hope you enjoy!</p>
