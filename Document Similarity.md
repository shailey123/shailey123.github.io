## Document Similarity in NLP and Text Mining
One of the biggest challenges in NLP and text mining is understanding and deriving insight from large volumes of txt data. One way of doing this is via document similarity. Document similarity enables matching of one document with another. This can be broken down into matching of a search query with a document, matching two queries with each other or matching documents. It can also be used an an input to rank documents. A key challenge with similarity measures is that there is no one accepted 'best' measure. Each meansure comes with its pros and cons and scenarios where it can be used.
